> "Hello, and thank you for giving me this opportunity.

I’m excited to present my full-stack AI chatbot application that I built using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and Docker for containerization.

This application simulates a customer support chatbot and is ready for deployment."

🗂 2. Codebase Walkthrough 

🧩 Project Structure

> "Here’s the folder structure of my project:"



chatbot-project/
├── backend/        # Node.js + Express API
├── frontend/       # React UI
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md

🔧 Backend (Node.js + Express)

> "The backend is a simple Express server with a single /api/chat POST endpoint.
It receives a message from the user and sends back a simulated AI response."



Open backend/index.js and say:

app.post('/api/chat', (req, res) => {
  const reply = AI: ${req.body.message};
  res.json({ reply });
});

> "CORS is also enabled to allow communication with the React frontend."




---

💻 Frontend (React)

> "The frontend is built using React. Inside ChatWindow.js, I’ve implemented a simple chat UI where the user can enter a message, which is sent to the backend using axios.
The bot’s response is then shown immediately in the chat window."



Show frontend/src/components/ChatWindow.js briefly.

⚙️ 3. Live Application Launch 

> "Now I’ll show you how the entire application runs using Docker."



Open terminal and run:

docker-compose up --build

> "This builds and starts both the frontend and backend containers.
The frontend runs on port 3000, and the backend on port 5000.
There is also a custom Nginx config to proxy /api/chat requests."



Wait for logs to show successful startup.

🌐 4. Live Application Demo

> "Now let me walk you through the live app."



Open browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

Type: "Hello, I need help with my order."

Bot replies: "AI: Hello, I need help with my order."


> "As you can see, the user’s message is sent to the backend via API, and the backend responds with a mock AI reply."



Demonstrate:

Another message: "What is your return policy?"

Bot responds: "AI: What is your return policy?"


> "This chat continues and shows full message history.
The chat window is scrollable and shows messages in order."
